# calculator

This project I coded from scratch without the aid of any tutorials, the challenge was to create a fully operational virtual calculator that could carry out all basic mathematical equations such as addition, subtraction, division and multiplication.

Challenges I faced creating this project were keeping track of how everything flowed the bigger the Javascript file became as well as which variables held what values.
It helped me along the way to use console.table to display all the values input into the equation as well as console logging a variable that kept track of which position of the equation was being worked on.

Another challenge was not having any test cases to run to verify the calculator still behaved as it should have when I wanted to refactor code, this meant it took much longer than I'd initially thought as I'd refactor code only to realise I'd reintroduced bugs I'd already fixed!

Something new I played around with was using git reset, git revert and git log --oneline. I'd like to grasp these concepts more strongly in the future.

Overall I'm proud that I created this from scratch, though on my next project I'd like to see if I can reduce the overall numbers of lines of code.
